## NEW!!
**[CUB3D](https://github.com/gitbrunoh/cube3d)**: This project is inspired by the world-famous game Wolfenstein 3D, which was the first FPS ever made. It allowed us to explore ray casting. The aim is to create a dynamic view inside a labyrinth.

## Main Projects
**[MINISHELL](https://github.com/nyykooo/Minishell)**: Emblematic project. It's a customised shell with lots of features and details that mimic Bash. I developed this amazing project alongside my colleague Nyko!  
**[FDF](https://github.com/gitbrunoh/fdf)**: So cool! This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.
